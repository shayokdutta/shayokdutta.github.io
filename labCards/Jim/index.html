I'll miss you being around at Rice but I'm so excited for you to have the adventure of your life next year in Taiwan! We'll always have a spot for you at Saturday tennis, the Rodeo, and every other random shenanigan and conversation like "how many days of your life would you give to be a bird" LOL. P.S. the color of that one shirt you have is awesome. See you again soon! Time to celebrate your accomplishments and continue being amazing!</p>

Although, I guess science is important as well. Looking forward to seeing what you get up to in the future. I’m incredibly jealous that you’re going to live in Taiwan….you have no idea how jealous I am. Why are you living my dream??? Next time we see each other again, you’ll have to tell me how that goes! Best of luck with the program and also at Duke!</p>

Since then it's become obvious that on top of being a great lab mate, you're a cool, funny dude. Sad to see you graduate and move on, but that just means you'll have even better adventures on the horizon. Hopefully those adventures don't include sterilizers failing and rats getting brain infections--you know, the standard grad school experience &#128521;. Anyhow take care, and best of luck as you become Dr. Jim in your next stage of life!</p>

We're going to miss having you here in person, learning random things about birds, satellites, weather balloons, circumpolar navigation, and just generally what life is like out in the real world.  You're always welcome to visit, and I hope we'll continue to collaborate on the various projects we dreamed up together. I hope that this is not a full good-bye but just more of a a "see you later".</p>

As someone with zero engineering skillz, I really appreciated your patience in helping me get up to speed, no matter how busy you already were. Every time I sit down to solder, I remember what you taught me! From Houston to Kauai, thanks for being the best travel guide, too. (I'll need to catch up about Mustang Island!)
