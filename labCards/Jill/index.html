      <p> <span class="w3-xlarge">Congrats on your fancy new physicsing job!</span> I don’t know if you remember, but our first conversation convinced me to quit dawdling and finalize my decision to major in electrical engineering. Outside of major life decisions, your stories have also sparked in me a desire to explore the world. Thanks for being an inspiration and a role model, and best of luck with the next story of your life!</p>

      <p><span class="w3-xlarge">Wow I can't believe it has finally come to this moment.</span> I'm sure you're aware, but it's quite bittersweet--bitter because you'll be moving on, but sweet because you'll be tackling the next cool opportunity. I have definitely enjoyed our interactions throughout grad school, whether commiserating on thesis/paper writing or talking about non-research topics such as the outdoors and traveling. There are of course many other things I could write, but then this would get too long; suffice it to say that I'm glad our grad school tenures overlapped these past 4 years. Keep in touch, and I wish you the best in your next endeavor!</p>

      <p><span class="w3-xlarge">"I can tell from how clean you keep your desk that you have a clean personal life."</span> These were simple yet very wise and impactful words that you had once bestowed upon me. I've since strived to keep not only a clean personal life but also a clean desk and thus am deeply indebted to you for the overall cleanliness. Jokes aside, it's crazy to think that it has been 4 years that we've overlapped. It seems like it has been both short and so long. I know we've both gone through our struggles during our grad student lives here so the overall support and random conversations on top of the technical discussions we've shared have been that much more meaningful to me. Thank you! Without rambling on much further, I just want to say I'm excited to hear from you in your post grad student life and hearing stories from your future vacations (will there be another Dr. Hammer story?)! Try to stay active on our more random slack channels while you yell Geaux Tigers again! :) </p>

      <p><span class="w3-xlarge">Congrats on finishing a chapter as a grad student and starting a brand new chapter at LSU!</span> I still remember the first day when I saw you at the grad preview before I even joined Rice. You probably don’t remember but we were just chatting with profs during break session and you told this cool story when working in Antarctica. And I thought to myself “wow this girl with a shoulder bag went to Antarctica for months at a time, what a brave soul! I wish I could do that!” And what do you know, fast forward four years later, we’ve been through so much together in lab and out, whether being slowing having the imaging experiment to work, or biking around the Bayou and getting wet soil all over my brand new white jacket. It’s been such a journey!! Thank you so much for your expertise helping me with my project and emotional support during tough times. I’m so sad not able to hear your playful comments around the office but truly happy for you to start your new chapter that I know you’ll enjoy! Keep in touch and best of wishes at your new job.</p>

We're going to miss having you here in person, learning random things about birds, satellites, weather balloons, circumpolar navigation, and just generally what life is like out in the real world.  You're always welcome to visit, and I hope we'll continue to collaborate on the various projects we dreamed up together. I hope that this is not a full good-bye but just more of a a "see you later".</p>

As someone with zero engineering skillz, I really appreciated your patience in helping me get up to speed, no matter how busy you already were. Every time I sit down to solder, I remember what you taught me! From Houston to Kauai, thanks for being the best travel guide, too. (I'll need to catch up about Mustang Island!) We'll miss you around here!</p>
